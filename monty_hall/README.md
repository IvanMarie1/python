# Simulation of Monty Hall Problem with Python

Simulate the Monty Hall Problem by repeating the game thousands of times in order to calculate the win probability if we switch door or not
You can edit the file to change parameters and see how it works

---

### Result of the simulation :
We can see that switching doors after one is opened give a better chance to win the game and the probability to win tends to 2/3

## Other parameters

Then I asked myself how the game would work if we change the rules.

Now there are 10 doors and only one of them is winning, the host can open 0 to 9 doors, so how it impacts the probability of winning

### Result of the simulation
So it seems that the win probabilty tends to (1+ number of doors opened)/10
