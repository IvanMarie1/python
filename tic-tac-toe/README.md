# tic tac toe


- A simple python file to play tic tac toe in the shell
- The code works mostly with lists

---
## Improvement ideas
- game interface (pygame or tkinter idk)
    - display the game
    - use the user click to play
    - better visual
    - sound effect / music
- multigame in one file run (restart, etc.)
    - save scores

---

Enjoy the game :)
